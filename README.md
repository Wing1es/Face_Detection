🚀 Deployed App
✅ Try the live face verification app here: [Hugging Face Space – Real-Time Face ID](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Shekarss/Face_Identification)

⚠️ Deployment Notice
🧠 The deployed app uses facenet-pytorch for real-time face verification. This repository also contains a custom-trained Siamese network for educational and comparison purposes.

❌ Why the Custom Siamese Network Doesn’t Work Well for Live Verification

It struggles with:

🔹 Limited Training Data
Small models trained on limited or synthetic datasets fail to generalize well to real-world conditions.

🔹 Not Robust to Real-World Variations

🔹 Different lighting conditions

🔹 Face angles and expressions

Webcam noise and blur

🔹 Shallow Architecture
The model has fewer layers and lacks high-level feature extraction capacity, which is essential for recognizing subtle facial differences.

🔹 No Face Alignment or Preprocessing Pipeline
Real-time faces vary in position and size; without alignment (like MTCNN), embeddings from different faces become inconsistent.

🔹 Sensitive to Overfitting
Due to its simplicity and lack of regularization, the model overfits to the training pairs and performs poorly on unseen faces.

✅ Why facenet-pytorch is Used for Deployment
✅ Pretrained on Millions of Faces (VGGFace2)
Learns general, high-quality face embeddings out of the box.

✅ Robust 512D Embeddings
Handles variations in lighting, angle, and noise with high accuracy.

✅ Real-Time Ready
Optimized for fast, accurate inference — perfect for webcam use in Hugging Face Spaces.

✅ Integrated Face Detection (MTCNN)
Automatically crops, aligns, and prewhitens faces before generating embeddings — boosting reliability.
